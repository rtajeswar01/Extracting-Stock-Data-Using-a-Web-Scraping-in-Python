Extracting Stock Data Using a Web Scraping in Python

Extracting stock data using web scraping in Python involves retrieving stock information from a website's HTML source code. This process typically includes using libraries such as Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML and extract relevant data elements, such as stock prices, volumes, dates, and other related information. The extracted data is then organized and stored in a suitable data structure, such as a Pandas DataFrame, for further analysis, visualization, or modeling. Web scraping allows for automated data collection from various sources, providing a convenient way to access and analyze stock market data for research, decision-making, and other purposes.
